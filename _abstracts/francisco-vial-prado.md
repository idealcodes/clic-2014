Ideal lattices played a fundamental role in the construction of the first Fully Homomorphic Encryption scheme. Indeed, these lattices were the mathematical object which validated the theoretical framework proposed by Gentry in his Ph.D. thesis. We will first give an overview of his construction, highlighting the importance of the ideal lattices involved. We then jump on time to describe fancy properties of recent FHE schemes : identity or attribute based FHE schemes, Multikey FHE schemes, Key-homomorphic FHE schemes, and discuss some open problems.
