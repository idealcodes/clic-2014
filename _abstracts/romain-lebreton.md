Contrary to the integer coefficient situation, lattice reduction with
polynomial coefficients can be done in polynomial time. In this talk,
we present the tools that provide the best current complexity for this
problem.  Order bases are the cornerstone of algorithms on matrices
with polynomial coefficients. We will present the mathematical
foundations of the notion of order basis. Then we will give a survey
of modern order basis algorithms. Finally, we will sketch the path
that goes from order bases to lattice reduction.
