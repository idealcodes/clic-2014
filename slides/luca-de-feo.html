# Reminder on lattices

A lattice in $‚Ñù^n$ is a *discrete subgroup* of $‚Ñù^n$ of rank $n$.

[Nice picture here]

A lattice is also

- An **abelian group**,
- A free **$‚Ñ§$-module** of rank $n$.

---

# Lattice reduction

Endow $‚Ñù^n$ with the $‚Ñì_2$ norm

$$|v|\_2 = \sqrt{\sum\_{i=1}^n|v\_i|^2}$$

**Fundamental problem:** find *shortest* vectors (by the $‚Ñì_2$ norm).

--

### Fundamental tool: LLL <small>(Lenstra‚ÄìLenstra‚ÄìLov√°sz)</small>

**Input:** A lattice $Œõ ‚äÇ ‚Ñù^n$ given by a basis.  
**Output:** A nonzero *somewhat short* vector $v ‚àà Œõ$ satisfying

$$|v|_2 ‚â§ 2^{(n-1)/4} \det(L)^{1/n}.$$

**Complexity:** polynomial-time.

???

In place of 2: anything > 4/3

# Small roots of modular equations

**Input**

- $f$ be a polynomial of degree $d$,
- $N$ an integer (of *unknown factorization*).

**Output:** All *small integers* $w$ such that *$f(w) = 0 \bmod N$*.

### Coppersmith's theorem

All $w$ such that *$|w| < N^{1/d}$* can be found in time polynomial in
$\log N$ and $d$.

# Application: RSA with stereotyped messages

Consider an RSA implementation with $N=pq$ and with *small public key*
(e.g.: $k_p=3$).

Suppose *a portion $B$* of the cleartext $m$ is *already known*, say
the high-order bits, so that

$$m = 2^aB + x$$

with $|x|<N^{1/3}$ unknown. Then, finding the small roots of the
equation

$$c = m^3 = (2^aB+x)^3 \mod N$$

recovers the ciphertext.

???

Obvious for B = 0.

# Coppersmith's intuition

Let $|w|<X$, and consider the lattice $Œõ$ spanned by the rows of $M$:

$$M = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & f_0\\\\
0 & X^{-1} & 0 & \cdots & 0 & f_1\\\\
0 & 0 & X^{-2} & \cdots & 0 & f_2\\\\
0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & X^{-d} & f_d\\\\
1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & N
\end{pmatrix}$$

If $w$ is a solution, then $f(w) = yN$ for some $y$, then

$$s=(1,w,\dots,w^d,-y)M = \left(1,w/X,\dots,(w/X)^d,0\right)$$

is in $Œõ$ and $|s|<\sqrt{d+1}$. If $s$ is small enough, LLL may find
it.

**However this does not work well.**

# Coppersmith's algorithm

**Idea:** find a *small polynomial* $g$ such that $g(w)=0$ in $‚Ñ§$ for
any *small solution* $w$ of $f \bmod N$.

Fix parameters $h$ and $X$. Define

$$g_{i,j}(x) = x^j N^{h-i} f^i(x) \qquad\qquad 0‚â§i<h, 0‚â§j<d.$$

**Remark:** $N^h$ divides $g_{i,j}(w)$ for any root $w$ of $f$.

---

Consider the lattice $Œõ$ spanned by the coefficients of *$g_{i,j}(x)$*:

$$\begin{pmatrix}
\\\\
\\\\
\\\\
\\\\
\\\\
\\\\
\\\\
\\\\
\end{pmatrix}$$

Vectors in $Œõ ‚ü∑$ polynomials $g$ such that $N^{h-1} | g(w)$.

---

We want a polynomial $g$ to be small in the *lattice sense* when
*$g(w)$ is small*.

Consider the lattice spanned by the coefficients of *$g_{i,j}(xX)$*:

$$\begin{pmatrix}
\\\\
\\\\
\\\\
\\\\
\\\\
\\\\
\\\\
\\\\
\end{pmatrix}$$

**Recall:**  $N^{h-1}|g(w)$

Suppose that $w<X$, and $g$ is *small enough*, then $g(w) = 0$ in $‚Ñ§$.
