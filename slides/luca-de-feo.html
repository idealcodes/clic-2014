# Reminder on lattices

A lattice is a subgroup of $ℤ^n$ of rank $n$.

Nice picture here.

---

# Lattice reduction



---

# Finding small roots

---

# Coppersmith's intuition

---

# Application 1: RSA with stereotyped messages

---

# Application 2: RSA with partial knowledge

---

# Other applications

---

# Coppersmith's theorem

---

# Howegrawe-..., May

---

# Example

---

# Finding small roots of bivariate polynomials?

---

# Analogies between integers and polynomials

---

# Small elements in $\F_p(z)$

---

# Coppersmith's method for $\F_p(z)$

---

# Reed-Solomon codes / approximate polynomial interpolation

---

# Reed-Solomon decoding via Coppersmith's method

---

# Further generalizations of Coppersmith's method
